For our project, we used jupyter notebook. To run the code, it is neccessary to have jupyter notebook installed in your computer. For this there are 3 options.

Full Anaconda (can take up to 3 Gb of space): Install Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook is included)
- Anaconda (it has most of the necessary packages installed and GUI, however, it takes 3 Gb of space) -> https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/  

Mini-version of Anaconda (takes less space): Install MiniConda and Jupyter Notebook
- https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- conda install jupyter (install Jupyter Notebook)  

No Anaconda, relying on the system Python: Installing Jupyter Notebook to the system environment
- In these instructions see the last section to install with pip and without Anaconda -> https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html  


After installing Jupyter Notebook you can simply run Jupyter notebook from command line:

jupyter notebook (alternatively open Anaconda prompt to open Jupyter Notebook)

After that you can open the downloaded notebook and access our code. It would be good to Kernel->Restart and run all(should run through if all the needed packages are installed, if it stops in the middle, the correct packages need to be installed by running command 'pip install *packageName*' on command line) before looking into it.
